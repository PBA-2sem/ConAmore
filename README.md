## Introduction
The purpose of the Con Amore assignment is to find a problem we would like to solve, with our knowledge about data structures and algorithms that we have acquired in the Algorithm and Datastructes course this semester.

## Thoughts
We were interested in trying to apply our knowledge about the topic *shortest path*s, to see if we could use it to find a solution to a "real life" problem, with the help of data in a graph-like structure.

[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) was our candidate algorithm, as it is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. 

We then began to think about
